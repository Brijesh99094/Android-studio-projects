let's go ahed with another app

list view app
where there is a custom list view which shows the list of items and then we click an item in it , it will show the detail view of that item


step 1:create a project :
step 2 :
	
	1.change the orientation to vertical into activity_main.xml.
	2.change the constraint layout to linearlayout
	3.add list view into the activity_main.xml file 
	
	so here the work of activity_main.xml is ready with all configuration

Now let's go ahed with the Main_activity.java

	
	first we declare necessary member variables in the class
			then get the listview that we have created in activity_main.xml
		ListVIew listview;
		create  instance using new of ArrayList of type Movie class
				for that first we have to create the Movie class with method and properties 
				add new java class 	
		CustomListAdapter adapter


			for that first we have to create the customListAdapter 
			add new activity and named it as customListAdapter
			now in it's .xml file we design our own view
				change the layout constraint to linear layout
				change the orientation to verical
				add another linear layout
				create your own view
				and also set the id's of all the control.
			now let's code for the customListAdapter

				extends ArrayAdapter of type  Movie
				declare two data member
					Context context;
					AraayList<Movie> movieList;

				create a constructor and pass this two argument
					do the super call .in costructor 
					and set this two data member to the parameter(parameterized constructor)

				
				create a public method which returns View with name getView 
				give the parameters int position,View convertView , ViewGroup parent
				now inside the method {

					set the view 
					View view = LayoutInflater.from(context).inflate(R.customListAdapter,null,false);

					now get the things that we have placed in the customListAdapter_activity.xml

					ImageView ,TextView
					set the value to the elements that we have get from the activity.xml
					
					return the view
				}
			Then come back to main activity.java
			where we gonna code for the movieList 
			and we add some movies  as an object 
			instantiate the customListAdapter that we have declared earlier and pass the required  parameter
			then set the adapter  to the listview
					
Note : put your all images into resource/drawable

			and then first run it you can see the list of movies in your customized listview.

			now whenever we click on any particular item it will show the detailed information of that movie
			so now we create detailed view
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now what we gonna do is that we are create a detailed view about movie so 
	we create another activity named detailed view
	let's first do some designing in the activity_detail.xml
	first change the layout constraint to linearlayout
	then change the orientation to vertical
	then put Image view for poster 
	and two TextView  for name and genre.
	now here the work of the xml file is over 
	now let's code it in DetailedActivity.java ,but before we have to set ItemClick on MainActivity's list of items which send the data of a single click movie.
	after setting the click onItemClick we create intent set the clicked movie to intent and start activity
	now we do code in Detailed activity
	first get all the elements from .xml view file
	the check for intent data
	if we have intent data them set it into the elements
