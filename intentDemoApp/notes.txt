creating an intenDemo app

start project 
build gradle

replacing the constraint view to LinearLayout
remove  the textView 

make orientation as vertical --- linear layout

add an EditText with textPersonname type and id = editText


adding buttons 

	add button for dialing a call(it will bring dial pad )
	add button for call
	add button for goto site
	add button for goto map
	few more buttons

here we have done the works of activity_main.xml us over 


----------------------------------------------
now the time to code 

starts with Main_activity.java

first declare the buttons and edittext as data members in class 
and then get it by it's id ...given in activity_main.xml 

now let's work on each and every button

first works on dial button
---------------------------
setOnClickListner on btndial
and  pass the paramerter new View.onclick
and  you will get onclick method automatically

now create an intent in that onclick event 
	Intent i = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_DIAL, Uri.parse("tel:" + editText.getText().toString()));
                startActivity(i);

and it works fine

second works on Call button 
----------------------------
thre is only one new thing we're gonna do is that we're gonna check for the  permission
so same way setOnClickListner on btncall
and create on click event

now create an intent with ACTION_CALL and give also the uri
and this time it's not gonna work as privious one.

 why.....................?
beacause we have't given the  permission to phone that our app can use the  phone functionality.
so we have to ask to user that he/she want to give permission to call or not
for that we have to add the  use permission into manifest file

 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CALL_PHONE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />

and then we have check the condition while  starting the activity
that user has allowed the permission then and then we can call using our own app
so now it is also done


3.third we are gonna enable button to browse the thing that is written in edit text
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
same way set onclick Listener button on the btnwebsite
and also set onclick event.
then create intent which take two paramerter one is action and another the text from the editText
then we have to start the activity and give the intent as parameter.

note:
-------
after this three functionality i have faced internet issue ....the internet is not working inside the emulator
and i got the solution .. on this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qtz0Z5otWeI&ab_channel=CodeWithRaghav


4.fourth is to open a map using your own app
--------------------------------------------
same thing setOnclickListener and add Onclick event and  create Intent
but here we have to pass "geo" into Uri.parse for getting the location
and then we attach the text from the editText
andt then after we start activity by passing the intent.
this is not properly working

5.now we are gonna use ListView using another activity ..
-----------------------------------------------------------
so we're gonna create an empty activity
so it will create two file 
	1.ListActivity.java
	2.activity_list.xml

first we modify the activity_list.xml
	change constraint view to linearLayout
	change the orientation to vertical
	then add the listview from design section of activity_list.xml
	set the id attribute of the listview.

so here we are ready with the design now let's code.....
we have to code in ListActivity.java file 
first we declare listview object and then we get it by find View By id.
create arrayList for adding items.
create arrayAdapter which is used to show the list of items
creating the object of arrayList 
add the items that you want to show in listview
creating the object of ArrayAdapter and  passing the resources to it.
setting the listVIew with the adapter
that's all.

now let's see how to select a particuler item from list and  view it on the main activity.
for that we have to set the setOnItemClickListener on the listview and give the parameter that new AdapterView.OnItemClickListener()
then create intent 
put your content using putExtra()
setResult code and intent as  per requested code
then finish()


now in the Main activity ,
generate overrided method onActivityResult
and then chekc for the reusltCode 
if the return result code is matched then show it into logcat or in console using the Log.d()
here we have finished over 5th functionality


6.btnStorage
-----------------
well i don't know how exactly it works
but let's see
first set the onclicklistner and generate onclick mehtod as earlier
it will take the image and show it in the image view 

7.btnCapture 
----------
it will capture the image and show it into image view
